1) Investigations
Still no answer from the design company.
Waiting for feedback on our initial MUST report.

2) Interviews
Assuming we do not receive an answer from the design company, we plan to interview other possible user candidates.
We plan to interview a data-entry user (about the CMS / data entry module) and a front-end user (about the interactive map).

Interview points for CMS-users:
- How would you imagine the workflow if you were asked to do X?
- What features would make it easier for you to perform these tasks?
- If you had to enter the same text on 100 different objects, how would you do that?
- Where would you want to be able to upload videos from? Your own computer? Youtube? Vimeo? Others?
- What kind of interface would be useful for uploading images? Batch uploading?

* Would probably be a good idea to perform the interview after the mockup? Or ask some questions before and others after the mockup presentation.


Interview points for front-end-users:
- What features would you expect to be in a product of this type?
- How would you navigate the map? Drag, swipe, on-screen buttons?
- How would you make the location dots visible without being annoying?
- - Blinking? Pulsating? Powerful colors?
* After the mockup:
- Did you feel any features were missing?
- Were any actions more cumbersome than you expected / would like?


3) Mock-ups / prototypes
Cardboard / pen & paper mockup for CMS, allowing interactive testing of the design before implementation begins.
Manifestation I guess?
Will be evaluated on whether the test participant can succesfully accomplish the following tasks:
- Creating a new object (location)
- Adding fields to the object
- Edit an existing object
- Remove an object
- Copy an object
- Make several objects use the same field
- Adding media (images, video, audio) to an object

Initially also cardboard mockup for end-user testing, to identify possible design problems before implementation begins.
Also a manifestation, I guess.
Will be evaluated on whether the test participant can succesfully accomplish the following tasks:
- Navigate the map: Move focus/camera, zoom in and out
- Click on flashing dots ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- Read text, view media
